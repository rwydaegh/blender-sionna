# Blender Sionna Integration: First Phase Development Plan

This document outlines the initial steps and feature development plan for integrating Sionna raytracing capabilities into a Blender addon. The long-term vision is to have a button within Blender that triggers a Sionna simulation of the scene. This plan breaks down the process into manageable phases, building upon the existing Blender-Flask object name echo application.

The application assumes that the Mitsuba renderer add-on is installed on Blender too. The source code  can be found here too. The idea is that the Blender file is converted to xml in the front-end and this file is sent to the backend with Sionna. But there can also be other items. One the first we want is a transmitter and receiver, of which you can see examples in the sionna_tutorials.py 

## Phase 1: Establish Basic Communication and Data Transfer

*   **Goal:** Extend the existing Blender-Flask application to send more complex scene data from Blender to the server.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Modify the Blender addon to extract basic scene information (e.g., list of object names, their types, simple transformations).
    *   Update the Flask server to receive and acknowledge this more complex data structure.
    *   Ensure reliable data transfer between Blender and the server.

## Phase 2: Integrate Sionna Environment Setup

*   **Goal:** Set up the server environment to run Sionna simulations and process scene data.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Develop server-side code to load the received scene data into a format usable by Sionna.
    *   Perform a minimal Sionna operation (e.g., setting up a basic scene or environment) using the received data.

## Phase 3: Basic Raytracing Simulation

*   **Goal:** Perform a simple Sionna raytracing simulation on the server using the data sent from Blender.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Implement server-side code to run a basic raytracing simulation based on the received scene data.
    *   Define a simple output from the simulation (e.g., a single value, a basic report).
    *   Modify the Flask server to send this simulation output back to the Blender addon.

## Phase 4: Display Simulation Results in Blender

*   **Goal:** Receive and display the simulation results from the server within the Blender addon.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Update the Blender addon to receive the simulation output from the server.
    *   Implement UI elements or console output in Blender to display the received results.

## Phase 5: Refine Data Transfer and Simulation Parameters

*   **Goal:** Improve the type and amount of scene data sent from Blender and allow for configurable simulation parameters.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify necessary scene data for more realistic simulations (e.g., material properties, light sources).
    *   Modify the Blender addon to extract and send this detailed data.
    *   Add UI elements in the Blender addon to allow users to configure basic Sionna simulation parameters (e.g., frequency, number of rays).
    *   Update the server to receive these parameters and use them in the simulation.

## Phase 6: Visualize Simulation Output in Blender

*   **Goal:** Develop methods to visualize the Sionna simulation output within the Blender 3D view.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Explore options for visualizing ray paths, signal strength, or other relevant simulation outputs in Blender (e.g., using grease pencil, generating mesh objects, custom drawing).
    *   Implement the chosen visualization method in the Blender addon based on the data received from the server.

## Next Steps (After Phase 6)

*   Implement more advanced Sionna features.
*   Optimize data transfer and simulation performance.
*   Improve the Blender addon UI and user experience.
*   Consider packaging and distribution of the addon.
